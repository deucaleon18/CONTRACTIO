# Description
It is a web-platform with frontend and UI managed by ReactJs and backend managed by Nodejs where the government user can log their contracts to the blockchain network which makes it immutable and the bidders can view the contract, submit their bids and when the government approves any bid that particular bidder successfully acquires the contract.

# Tech Stacks Used

# Features
* Every user, the government or the bidder register on the platform.
* The government adds a contract after approval with all the details to the blockchain network.
* The bidder can see the contract and add his bid, if interested.
